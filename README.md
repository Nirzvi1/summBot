# summBot

summBot is a Summarizer Chrome Extension that analyzes the document tree of the article being viewed and displays a summary of it. It analysis the text by frequency of word use over all the sentences.

## Instructions

summBot is very easy to use. When viewing an article (e.g. Wikipedia, news site, etc.), simply select a word in the article and right-click on it. From the resulting drop-down menu, select "Summarize article...".
If the article is extremely long, summBot may take some time to process it. While it's processing the article, the summBot icon in the top-right of Chrome will have a blue square. Once it's finished, it will display a green square and you can view the summary by clicking on summBot's icon.

### Next Steps

Currently, summBot's summary technique is fairly simplistic. I'm hoping to make its summarizing algorithm far more interesting and effective when I have more time.
